# Minds4Change
This project has been realized in the form of slides in different editions (from the initial to the final version) for the course "Innovation Ecosystems for Impact", which is part of the Path of Excellence "Intraprendenti", organized by the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy.
Everything has been created though the joint contribution of a set of students who made a group work:
- Marco De Luca, Computer Engineering
- Edoardo Bargis, Biomedial Engineering
- Giorgia Benedetti, Design and Communication
- Nicol√≤ Briatico, Mathematical Engineering
- Luca Camagna, Physics Engineering
- Simone Costantino, Aerospace Engineering
- Francesca Delleani, Automotive Engineering

Slides are provided in Italian language. For any translation, please feel free to contact me :)
